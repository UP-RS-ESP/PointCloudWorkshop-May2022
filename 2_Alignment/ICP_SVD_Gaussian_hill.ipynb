    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is about the basics of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based Iterative Closest Point (ICP) point cloud alignment approach. The goal is to develop our own implementation using only Numpy, which we can then illustrate and test on synthetic point clouds. Our toy model for this lab is a Gaussian hill which is a smooth and easy to sample surface, because the elevation $z$ of the hill can be expressed as a function of the coordinates $x$ and $y$:\n",
    "$$z(x, y) = e^{-x^2-y^2} \\;.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A synthetic point cloud $p$ from this model can be generated by randomly sampling $(x, y)$ coordinates and then calculating the corresponding $z$ coordinates from the model function. For testing purposes a second synthetic point cloud $q$ that is not aligned to the first can be retrieved from the first by rotating and translating it in three dimensions."

    "## Absolute Orientation Problem and Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our point clouds $p$ and $q$ are actually the same point cloud in two different coordinate systems, there is a rigid-body transformation that transforms one exactly into the other. Finding this transformation is called absolute orientation problem and for known associations, i.e., which point in q corresponds to which point in p, there are direct solutions. One direct approach is to translate by the difference between centroids and then decompose the cross co-variance matrix in its rotational parts, combine those and take that as the rotational difference."
